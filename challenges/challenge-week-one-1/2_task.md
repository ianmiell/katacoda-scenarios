Write a script called `file_reporter.sh` that

- lists all the files under your home folder, and
- the number of lines in each file

The output should look like this:

```
file1 is in the folder /root, and has 2 lines
file2 is in the folder /root/, and has 3 lines
[...]
```

and be stored in the file `/root/output`
